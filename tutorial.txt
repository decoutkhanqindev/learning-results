### 1. **`config`**
- **Role:** Stores configuration files and environment-specific settings.
- **Contents:**
  - Database connection settings (e.g., MongoDB URI).
  - External service configurations (e.g., APIs, third-party services).
  - Server configurations like port number, environment variables, etc.
  - Configuration for things like authentication, JWT secret, or other global settings.
  
  Example: 
  - `config/mongodb.js` for setting up the MongoDB connection.
  - `config/env.js` for loading environment variables from `.env`.

### 2. **`controllers`**
- **Role:** Contains logic that handles requests and responses. Each controller corresponds 
to a resource or entity in your application.
- **Contents:**
  - Functions that handle HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for specific routes.
  - Typically communicates with services and models to fetch, create, update, or delete data, 
  and then returns the results in the response.
  
  Example: 
  - `controllers/userController.js` to handle user registration, login, etc.
  - `controllers/productController.js` for product-related operations.

### 3. **`helpers`**
- **Role:** Contains utility functions or helper methods that are used across different parts 
of the application.
- **Contents:**
  - Helper functions for things like formatting data, validation, date/time manipulation, etc.
  - Custom functions that simplify commonly used operations, reducing repetitive code.
  
  Example: 
  - `helpers/validation.js` for input validation functions.
  - `helpers/logger.js` to set up a logger for the application.

### 4. **`middlewares`**
- **Role:** Holds middleware functions that process requests before they reach the controllers.
- **Contents:**
  - Functions that intercept HTTP requests for purposes such as authentication, logging, validation, etc.
  - Middleware functions are executed sequentially before reaching the route handler in the controller.
  
  Example:
  - `middlewares/authMiddleware.js` to verify user authentication via JWT.
  - `middlewares/errorHandler.js` to handle errors globally.

### 5. **`models`**
- **Role:** Defines the data structure for your application and interacts with the database (MongoDB in this case).
- **Contents:**
  - Mongoose models that define the schema for each entity in the application (e.g., User, Product, Order).
  - Methods to interact with MongoDB, like `find()`, `save()`, `update()`, etc.
  
  Example:
  - `models/userModel.js` for defining the schema and model for users.
  - `models/productModel.js` for defining the schema and model for products.

### 6. **`public`**
- **Role:** Stores static files that are accessible to the client (browser).
- **Contents:**
  - Static assets like images, CSS files, JavaScript files, fonts, etc.
  - These files are served directly to the client without any backend processing.
  
  Example:
  - `public/css/` for CSS files.
  - `public/images/` for image files.

### 7. **`routes`**
- **Role:** Defines the API routes that handle incoming requests and map them to the 
corresponding controllers.
- **Contents:**
  - Route definitions, where you specify HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and the corresponding 
  controllers to handle them.
  - Organizes routes for each resource in the application (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
  
  Example:
  - `routes/userRoutes.js` for routes related to user operations (login, register).
  - `routes/productRoutes.js` for routes related to product operations.

### 8. **`services`**
- **Role:** Contains business logic or complex operations that need to be reused by 
multiple controllers.
- **Contents:**
  - Functions that handle the core application logic, such as interacting with multiple models or 
  performing operations across multiple resources.
  - Service functions typically help keep controllers focused on routing logic, while services 
  handle the "heavy lifting."
  
  Example:
  - `services/authService.js` for handling authentication logic (JWT generation, password hashing).
  - `services/productService.js` for handling product-specific logic (calculating discounts, handling inventory).

### 9. **`views`**
- **Role:** Contains templates that are rendered to generate HTML content dynamically (if using 
server-side rendering with view engines like EJS, Pug, etc.).
- **Contents:**
  - HTML templates or views that render data from the server dynamically.
  - These are used if you're building a web app that serves HTML pages, rather than just an API.

  Example:
  - `views/index.ejs` for the main page of your application.
  - `views/login.ejs` for the login page.

### MVC Structure Example

For example, in an e-commerce app, you might have the following files:

```
/config
  - mongodb.js          # MongoDB connection setup
  - env.js              # Environment variable setup

/controllers
  - userController.js    # Controller for user-related routes
  - productController.js # Controller for product-related routes

/helpers
  - validation.js        # Helper functions for validating inputs
  - logger.js            # Logger for logging messages

/middlewares
  - authMiddleware.js    # Middleware to check authentication

/models
  - userModel.js         # Mongoose model for users
  - productModel.js      # Mongoose model for products

/public
  - css/                 # Static CSS files
  - images/              # Static image files

/routes
  - userRoutes.js        # API routes for user-related actions
  - productRoutes.js     # API routes for product-related actions

/services
  - authService.js       # Business logic for authentication (JWT, password hashing)
  - productService.js    # Business logic for product management

/views
  - index.ejs            # Main HTML view (if using server-side rendering)
  - login.ejs            # Login page HTML
```
